			<h1>Increased Reliability</h1>
			
			<p>
				Servers are designed to run at all times, even in the event of a 
				hardware failure. That's why many servers are equipped with redundant
				power supplies. Normally, if one of the power supplies dies, the server
				would automatically shutdown. Resulting in lose data and unproductive
				employees. With a secondary power supply running in tandem, the lost of
				one of the power supplies doesn't effect normal system operations and
				as a result, goes unnoticed by the users.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The same goes for a server's storage system. Unlike an average desktop
				PC that uses a single hard drive. A server will typically use multiple
				hard drives working in a RAID configuration to prevent data lose or an
				interruption in work-flow due to the failure of a solitary hard disk.
				There are many different levels of RAID to choose from and it can be
				implemented via either a hardware RAID controller or thru-software.
				The most popular configurations of RAID are RAID-1 and RAID-5.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				With the redundant hard drive or power supply engaged, you're still left
				with the problem of replacing the failed hardware. On a desktop, when 
				any hardware fails you need to shut the system down in order to repair
				it. This isn't an acceptable condition for a server since whenever the 
				server is down your employees are unable to function. It's for this
				reason that many servers are also equipped with hot swappable hard 
				drives and power supplies. Like with the redundant systems, these hot 
				swappable components allow you to replace faulty hardware without 
				interrupting the entire office.
