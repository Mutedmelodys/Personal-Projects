			<h2>Memory</h2>
			
			<p>
				In computing, memory refers to the computer hardware integrated circuits that store information for immediate use in a computer; 
				it is synonymous with the term "primary storage". Computer memory operates at a high speed, for example random-access memory (RAM), as 
				a distinction from storage that provides slow-to-access information but offers higher capacities. If needed, contents of the computer 
				memory can be transferred to secondary storage, through a memory management technique called "virtual memory". An archaic synonym for 
				memory is store.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The term "memory", meaning "primary storage" or "main memory", is often associated with addressable semiconductor memory, i.e. 
				integrated circuits consisting of silicon-based transistors, used for example as primary storage but also other purposes in computers 
				and other digital electronic devices. There are two main kinds of semiconductor memory, volatile and non-volatile. Examples of 
				non-volatile memory are flash memory (used as secondary memory) and ROM, PROM, EPROM and EEPROM memory (used for storing firmware such 
				as BIOS). Examples of volatile memory are primary storage, which is typically dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), and fast CPU cache 
				memory, which is typically static random-access memory (SRAM) that is fast but energy-consuming, offering lower memory areal density 
				than DRAM.
			</p>
			
			<p>		
				Most semiconductor memory is organized into memory cells or bi-stable flip-flops, each storing one bit (0 or 1). Flash memory 
				organization includes both one bit per memory cell and multiple bits per cell (called MLC, Multiple Level Cell). The memory cells are 
				grouped into words of fixed word length, for example 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128 bit. Each word can be accessed by a binary address 
				of N bit, making it possible to store 2 raised by N words in the memory. This implies that processor registers normally are not 
				considered as memory, since they only store one word and do not include an addressing mechanism.
