			<h2>Network Connection</h2>
			
			<p>
				A computer network, or data network, is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources. In computer 
				networks, computing devices exchange data with each other using connections between nodes (data links.) These data links are established 
				over cable media such as wires or optic cables, or wireless media such as Wi-Fi.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Network computer devices that originate, route and terminate the data are called network nodes. Nodes can include hosts such as 
				personal computers, phones, servers as well as networking hardware. Two such devices can be said to be networked together when one 
				device is able to exchange information with the other device, whether or not they have a direct connection to each other. In most cases, 
				application-specific communications protocols are layered (i.e. carried as payload) over other more general communications protocols. 
				This formidable collection of information technology requires skilled network management to keep it all running reliably.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Computer networks support an enormous number of applications and services such as access to the World Wide Web, digital video, digital 
				audio, shared use of application and storage servers, printers, and fax machines, and use of email and instant messaging applications 
				as well as many others. Computer networks differ in the transmission medium used to carry their signals, communications protocols to 
				organize network traffic, the network's size, topology, traffic control mechanism and organizational intent. The best-known computer 
				network is the Internet.
