			<h2>The Motherboard</h2>
			<p>
				A motherboard (sometimes alternatively known as the main board, system board, baseboard, planar board 
				or logic board, or colloquially, a mobo) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) found in general 
				purpose microcomputers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of 
				the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and 
				provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant 
				sub-systems such as the central processor, the chip set's input/output and memory controllers, interface 
				connectors, and other components integrated for general purpose use.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Motherboard specifically refers to a PCB with expansion capability and as the name suggests, this board is 
				often referred to as the "mother" of all components attached to it, which often include peripherals, 
				interface cards, and daughter-cards: sound cards, video cards, network cards, hard drives, or other forms of 
				persistent storage; TV tuner cards, cards providing extra USB or FireWire slots and a variety of other 
				custom components.
