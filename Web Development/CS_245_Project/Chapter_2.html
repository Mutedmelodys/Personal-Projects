			<h1> File and Network security </h1>
			
			<p>
				The most important role of a file server is 
				the network security it provides. By creating individual user and group
				accounts, rights can be assigned to the data stored on the network
				preventing unauthorized users from accessing materials they shouldn't 
				be viewing. For example, the people on the sales floor don't need access
				to employee's personal records. That information is reserved for HR or 
				the company owners.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The server allows you to manage file access on one system rather than on
				each workstation individually; which saves time and effort. Plus if a 
				user's workstation fails, that employee can go to another workstation
				to continue working on the same files.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Also, all users can store their documents within their own personal
				folder on the server. The benefit to this is two-fold. First, data
				stored in a user's personal folder can only be viewed by the user
				themselves. Second, since all of your employee's data is being stored
				on the network, it gets backed up nightly with the rest of the network
				data, thus ensuring that nothing will be lost due to a crashed
				workstation.
