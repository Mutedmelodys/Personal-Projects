			<h1>Centralized Backup</h1>
			
			<p>
				All businesses should backup their data on a regular basis. By having
				all of your company and employee data stored in one location, backups
				can be performed reliably and quickly. So you'll never need to worry
				about what data is stored on what workstation as you do in a
				peer-to-peer network. Today almost any media type can be used for
				backup purposes. In addition to the traditional tape drive, CDs,
				DVDs, removal storage and even Network Attached Storage (NAS) 
				devices are acceptable. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Your choice of media will depend on your
				specific backup requirements. Depending on your budget and your
				data retention needs, any of these would be an acceptable solution. 
				Make sure you have at least a scheduled weekly backup, although a 
				daily would be better.
