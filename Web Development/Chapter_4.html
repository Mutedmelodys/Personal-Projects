			<h1>Virus Management</h1>
			
			<p>
				One of the greatest threats to your network is the possibility of
				infection from viruses, spy-ware and spam. So having good, updated, 
				anti-virus software installed on your systems is a necessity. In an 
				office of 10 people or less, systems can be maintained individually.
				Anything more than that, though, can become a real burden. In those 
				circumstances, an anti-virus package that combines workstation and 
				server virus protection into a single solution makes more sense.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Numerous vendors make anti-virus suites designed specifically around 
				the needs of a small business. A package like this allows a single 
				network administrator to manage every aspect of the anti-virus software
				from a centralized location; thereby reducing administration and
				maintenance cost.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				From a single PC, the administrator can deploy the latest anti-virus 
				software to each workstation on the network, run network wide virus
				scans, patch software and update virus definition files. The software 
				is designed to use minimal system resources and run in the background
				of a client PC; constantly watching for signs of trouble. Many tasks,
				like virus sweeps and definitions updates can be automated,giving you 
				piece of mind and a feeling of security.
