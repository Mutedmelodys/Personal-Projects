			<h1>Why Businesses Use Servers</h1>
			
			<p>
				Peer-to-peer networks don't provide you with much in the way of
				security and resource sharing can be somewhat problematic. So, not 
				surprisingly, they often had problems accessing workstations, lost 
				data due to viruses or spy-ware or would experience intermittent
				Internet problems. PCs networked in a peer-to-peer fashion are adequate
				when you only have a few users on the network, but once you have more
				then 5 or 6 users on your network, then you really need to consider
				investing in a network server.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Many people are under the misconception that a server is no different
				from a typical desktop PC. This couldn't be further from the truth. 
				While almost any PC that meets the minimum hardware requirements can 
				run the server operating system, that doesn't make it a true server.
				A desktop system is optimized to run a user-friendly operating system, 
				desktop applications, and facilitate other desktop oriented tasks.
				Even if the desktop had similar processor speeds, memory and storage 
				capacity, it still isn't a replacement for a real server. The 
				technologies behind them are engineered for different purposes
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A server is engineered to manage, store, send and process data, 
				24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 356 days a year. For these reasons, 
				servers need to be far more reliable then their desktop counterparts. 
				In order to accomplish this, servers offer a variety of features not 
				typically found in a desktop PC.
